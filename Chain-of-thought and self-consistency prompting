Chain-of-thought and self-consistency prompting
You learned about advanced prompting techniques for language models, focusing on chain-of-thought and self-consistency prompting. These methods enhance the model's ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks by providing detailed, step-by-step explanations of its thought process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs.

Chain-of-thought prompting requires the model to outline its reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. This approach is especially useful for complex problems, as it breaks down the model's thought process into understandable segments. For instance, when solving a math problem, the model explains each step of its calculation, making its reasoning transparent and easier to follow.

Self-consistency prompting involves generating multiple chain-of-thought responses and selecting the most common answer as the final output. This technique addresses the issue of potential errors in a single chain of thought by aggregating multiple reasoning paths, thereby increasing the likelihood of a correct answer.

Here's an example of how you might set up a chain-of-thought prompt in Python using the OpenAI API:

# Set your API key
client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Create the chain-of-thought prompt
prompt = "Compute the age of my friend's father in 10 years, given that now he's double my friend's age, and my friend is 20. Give a step by step explanation."

response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)
This lesson equipped you with strategies to refine prompts iteratively through experimentation, ensuring more meaningful interactions with language models.

The goal of the next lesson is to learn how to improve communication with language models through the practice of refining prompts.
